libtcod-test
============

This "game" was made as a test of libtcods pythoin bindings.

You start on the map with 10 enemies. They are perfectly harmless,
in fact, they really really like you. Don't let them swarm you.

Navigate with numpad and exit with `Esc`.

There's no win condition, but the unoptimized code will make the "endgame" 
unplayable. Consider this as a loss.


Installation
------------

Download libtcod 1.6.0. Put `libtcodpy.py`, `libtcod.so` and `terminal8x8_gs_tc.png` in this 
directory. Run `python start.py`.
